# Rick and Morty Favorite List â€” Tech Test

## About
This technical test aims to evaluate your ability to identify and fix known bugs in a Next.js application using React Query and Zustand. The project is a simple favorite list for Rick and Morty characters, consuming the public API.

## Purpose
The main goal is to demonstrate that you can:
- Identify and correct small and large bugs in a real-world codebase
- Work with Next.js, React Query, Zustand and modern front-end tools
- Apply best practices in React, TypeScript and UI

## What to do
- Analyze the code, run the project and navigate through the screens
- Fix the bugs and issues you find
- Feel free to suggest improvements in UX, code or architecture

## Stack
- Next.js (App Router, TypeScript)
- React Query
- Zustand
- Tailwind CSS

## Tips
- Read the code carefully, including components and the store
- Test the favorite/unfavorite features
- Pay attention to runtime errors, warnings and unexpected behaviors

Good luck!
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
